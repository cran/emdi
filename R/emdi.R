#' A package for estimating and mapping disaggregated indicators
#'
#' The package \code{emdi} supports estimating and mapping regional
#' disaggregated indicators. For estimating these indicators the Empirical Best
#' Prediction approach by \cite{Molina and Rao (2010)}is provided. Estimates of 
#' the mean square error for these methods can be conducted by using a 
#' parametric bootstrap approach (\cite{Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. 2008}). 
#' Furthermore, a mapping tool for plotting the estimates on their geographic 
#' regions is provided. Point and uncertainty measures as well as diagnostic 
#' tests can be easily extracted to excel.
