\usage{
\method{compare}{fh}(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of type "model","fh".}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The null hypothesis, the value W of the test statistic, the degrees 
of freedom and the p value of the Brown test; and the correlation coefficient 
of the synthetic part and the direct estimator \cite{(Chandra et al. 2015)}.
}
\description{
Method \code{compare.fh} assesses the quality of the model-based estimates by 
comparing them with the direct estimates based on a goodness-of-fit test 
proposed by \cite{Brown et al. (2001)} and by computing the correlation between the 
regression-synthetic part of the Fay-Herriot model and the direct estimates.
