\title{Direct estimation of disaggregated indicators}
\usage{
direct(y, smp_data, smp_domains = NULL, weights = NULL, design = NULL,
  threshold = NULL, var = FALSE, boot_type = "naive", B = 50,
  seed = 123, X_calib = NULL, totals = NULL, custom_indicator = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a character indicating the variable that is used for estimating the 
indicators.}

\item{smp_data}{survey data containing the above variable as well as sampling
domains, and weights if selected.}

\item{smp_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable
that indicates domains in the sample data. The variable can be numeric or a
factor.}

\item{weights}{a character containing the name of a variable for 
the sampling weights in the sample data. This argument is optional and defaults
to \code{NULL}.}

\item{design}{a character containing the name of a variable for different 
strata for stratified sampling designs. This argument is optional and defaults
to \code{NULL}.}

\item{threshold}{a number defining a threshold. Alternatively, a threshold may 
be defined as a \code{function} of \code{y} and \code{weights} returning a 
numeric value. Such a function will be evaluated once for the point 
estimation and in each iteration of the parametric bootstrap. A threshold is
needed for calculation e.g. of head count ratios and poverty gaps. The 
argument defaults to \code{NULL}. In this case the threshold is set to 60\% 
of the median of the variable that is selected as y similary to the 
At-risk-of-poverty rate used in the EU (see also \cite{Social Protection Committee 2001}). 
However, any desired threshold can be chosen.}

\item{var}{if TRUE, estimates for the variance are calcualted using a 
naive or calibrated bootstrap. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{boot_type}{a character containing the name of the bootstrap specification. 
Either a \code{"naive"} or a \code{"calibrate"} bootstrap can be used. See 
also \code{\link[laeken]{bootVar}}. Defaults to \code{naive}.}

\item{B}{a number determining the number of bootstrap populations for the 
bootstrap variance. Defaults to \code{50}.}

\item{seed}{an integer to set the seed for the random number generator. Random 
number generation is used in the bootstrap approach. If no seed is set, seed
is chosen randomly. Defaults to \code{123}.}

\item{X_calib}{a numeric matrix including calibration variables if the calibrated 
bootstrap is chosen. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{totals}{a numeric vector providing the population totals if the calibrated 
bootstrap is chosen.. Defaults to \code{NULL}. In this case, the sampling 
weights are used to calculate the totals.}

\item{custom_indicator}{a list of functions containing the indicators to be
calculated additionaly. Such functions must and must only depend on the
target variable \code{y}, the \code{weights} and the threshold (numeric value)
\code{threshold}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{na.rm}{if TRUE, observations with \code{NA} values are deleted from the 
sample data. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "emdi" that provides direct estimators for regional
disaggregated indicators and optionally corresponding variance estimates. Generic
functions such as \code{\link{estimators}}, \code{\link{print}}, 
and \code{\link{summary}} have methods that can be used
to obtain further information. See \code{\link{emdiObject}} for descriptions
of components of objects of class "emdi".
}
\description{
Function \code{direct} estimates indicators only based on sample information. 
The variance is estimated via a naive or calibrated bootstrap. The estimation
is adapted from the estimation of direct indicators in package 
\pkg{laeken}.
}
\details{
The set of predefined indicators includes the mean, median, four further quantiles
(10\%, 25\%, 75\% and 90\%), head count ratio, poverty gap, Gini coefficient
and the quintile share ratio.
